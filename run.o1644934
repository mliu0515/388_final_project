User: what is the recipe of mayonnaise?

> Assistant: The classic condiment! Mayonnaise is a thick, creamy sauce made from a combination of oil, egg yolks, acid (such as vinegar or lemon juice), and seasonings. Here's a simple recipe to make mayonnaise at home:

**Ingredients:**

* 2 egg yolks
* 1 tablespoon lemon juice or vinegar (such as white wine vinegar or apple cider vinegar)
* 1/2 teaspoon Dijon mustard (optional)
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/4 cup (60 ml) neutral-tasting oil, such as canola, grapeseed, or sunflower oil

**Instructions:**

1. **Start with room temperature ingredients**: This is important, as cold ingredients can prevent the mayonnaise from emulsifying properly.
2. **In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together** the egg yolks, lemon juice or vinegar, Dijon mustard (if using), and salt until well combined.
3. **Slowly pour in the oil**: While continuously whisking the egg yolk mixture, slowly pour in the oil in a thin, steady stream. Start with a slow drizzle and gradually increase the flow as the mixture thickens.
4. **Continue whisking until the mixture thickens**: It's essential to whisk constantly to prevent the oil from separating from the egg yolks. You'll know the mayonnaise is thickening when it becomes creamy and emulsified, which should take about 5-7 minutes.
5. **Taste and adjust**: Once the mayonnaise is thickened, taste it and adjust the seasoning as needed. If it's too thick, add a little water. If it's not thick enough, add a little more oil.
6. **Store the mayonnaise**: Transfer the mayonnaise to an airtight container and refrigerate it for at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together. Mayonnaise can be stored in the fridge for up to 1 week.

**Tips and Variations:**

* Use a neutral-tasting oil to prevent the mayonnaise from having a strong flavor.
* If you're worried about raw eggs, you can use pasteurized eggs or egg substitutes.
* Add flavorings like minced garlic, chopped fresh herbs (such as parsley or dill), or grated ginger to create different variations.
* For a lighter mayonnaise, use
